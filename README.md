# MemeME
Project Overview

This app is a part from Udacity Nanodegree program and this enables a user to take a picture, and add text at the top and bottom to form a meme. The user will be able to share the photo on Facebook and Twitter and also by SMS or email.

Why this project?

MemeMe covers many of the major UI components found in essentially every app. It combines them with the camera and social media activity view to create a fun and personal user experience.

What I've learnt?

Accessing the Camera and Photo Album using the UIImagePickerController
Understanding how Swift optionals, closures, collections, classes, structs and protocols are used in iOS apps
Creating Actions and Outlets with extremely high proficiency
Using a UIActivityViewController to share media with Facebook, Twitter, SMS, and Email
Describing the delegate pattern and give a full account of its importance and uses in iOS classes

Why is this project meaningful to my career?

Becoming comfortable using a variety of UIControls and stock view controllers is an essential step to make me an iOS developer.
Understanding UIKit allows me to make educated assumptions about the architecture of apps that I use.
Mastering UKit fundamentals frees me up to learn model-oriented skills like networking and persistence.
